# GuessingGameChallenge
This is a game in which user has to guess a number between 1 to 100. And, the number of guesses taken to guess the actual number is the score the user gets.

The program starts by:
* Printing the rules of the game to the user  
* Then, it asks the user for a guess between 1 to 100  
* If the guess is closer than 10 or less digits to the actual number, the program prints WARM!, or else prints COLD!  
* Again, the programs keeps on asking the user for guesses until the guess matches the actual number.
* If next guess is closer than the previous guess, the program prints WARMER, or else COLDER.  
* When the user is able to match the guess, the program congratulates the user and displays the number of guesses taken by the user.
